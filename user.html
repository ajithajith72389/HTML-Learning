        <p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through television sets
            all
            over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school CRT television at
            a
            local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator in Ranchi awaited the birth of his third child.
        </p>
        
        <p><b>'Dhoniiiii finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years.
                The
                party's started in the dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely magnificent, in the
                night of the
                final.’</b></p>
        
        <p>Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni
            enchanted
            the Wankhede on the night of 2nd April 2011.</p>
        
        <h3 style="background-color: aquamarine; color:grey">The Foundation</h3>
        <p>Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of
            rebellion,
            extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E.
            teacher
            as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenage boy with no measurable
            upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers of the district. However, the system
            failed him as he found it difficult to make the cut against candidates of the more affluent A-tier states.
            Consequently,
            in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur
            railway station to make ends meet.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in a few months, the stars started to align themselves for the precocious wunderkind from Ranchi.
            Inspired
            by the KSCA, the BCCI started a country-wide Training Research Development Wing to scout talent from the more
            financially backward states. Dhoni immediately caught the eyes of the scouts and was sent on an A tour to Kenya,
            where
            his talent burst forth for the world to see as he showcased his batting pyrotechnics against world-class bowlers in
            alien conditions. He immediately shot to national reckoning and was selected for the tour of Bangladesh in November
            2004.</p>
        <p>By then a broad 22-year-old with long locks, Dhoni’s India career got off to an inauspicious start, as he scored a
            duck
            in his first ODI and a string of low scores followed. However, the selectors and the then-captain Sourav Ganguly
            decided
            to persist with him and gave him an extended run. Dhoni repaid their faith with an exhibition of his charisma and
            audacious stroke-play in his fifth ODI against Pakistan, who certainly didn’t see the butchery coming, as he
            butchered
            his way to 148 at Vishakhapatnam. Later in 2005, he went one step further bludgeoning his way to a brutal 183* in
            Jaipur
            to make a mockery of a 300-run chase against a Sri Lankan attack that looked aghast at his bizarre-but-effective
            stroke-play and the unparalleled physical power that he imparted on the ball.</p>
        <p>In a state where leather ball cricket was a luxury, Dhoni grew up playing tennis ball cricket tournaments. With heavy
            Kashmir willow bats, light and hollow tennis balls, and long boundaries, he developed a bottomhand-dominated
            technique
            to impart maximum power on the light tennis ball which undergoes energy-damping upon impact. However, Dhoni stood
            out
            when he, along with a friend, developed an elevated body-weight shot with an exaggerated follow-through that cleared
            boundaries with ease. On that count, cricketing folklore will remember MS Dhoni as the man who had the audacity to
            play
            the 'helicopter shot' against the leather ball.</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: aquamarine; color:grey">Captaincy</h3>
        <p>With a mature head on his shoulders and an astute and shrewd cricketing mind, Dhoni was recommended by senior players
            like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for captaincy after Rahul Dravid stepped down as skipper.</p>
        <p>On his first assignment in the inaugural World T20 in 2007, Dhoni and his young troops romped to the title in a shock
            victory for the inexperienced Indian side, bringing about the T20 revolution in India. Dhoni's calm and composed
            leadership was widely lauded in the cricketing fraternity after India brought the trophy home, earning him the label
            of
            ‘Captain Cool’. He was soon handed the ODI leadership as a natural move after his World T20 triumph, and after the
            retirement of Anil Kumble in late 2008, the Test leadership was thrust upon him too.</p>
        <p>Dhoni had a golden run as captain, with an unbeaten run in Test series since his captaincy debut, leading them to
            their
            first stint as the top-ranked Test team in the world. His winning streak included the home series against Australia
            in
            2008, a 1-0 triumph in New Zealand in 2009, and a 2-0 victory against Sri Lanka at home, culminating in a
            comprehensive
            win at the Brabourne stadium, Mumbai, where he received the coveted Test Championship mace. India continued to
            dominate
            in home Tests after this and drew a series in South Africa, coming very close to their maiden series win in South
            Africa
            in the decider in Cape Town, where some stoic resistance by the hosts narrowly saved them from the a defeat at the
            hands
            of a rampaging Indian side in top form.</p>
        <p>Dhoni continued to garner praise for his success across formats; especially for his clinical success in limited-overs
            cricket, reaching the pinnacle of his captaincy career during India's path to glory in the 2011 World Cup. Dhoni’s
            India
            knocked out Australia, the holders of the World Cup since 1999, in the quarter-final in Ahmedabad. Having gone
            through a
            patch of lackluster form throughout the tournament, Dhoni peaked at the right time, exhibiting his usual sangfroid
            on
            the way to 91* in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka, and lofted an iconic six over long-on, triggering
            night-long
            celebrations all over Mumbai and the rest of India.</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: aquamarine; color:grey">Transition Period - A rebuilding phase</h3>
        <p>After the World Cup, the Indian team saw a difficult transition period. Dhoni's shrewd captaincy came under severe
            scrutiny during the 8 successive losses in England and Australia. In the aftermath of the overseas failures, which
            included England toppling them over as the number 1 Test side in the world, a fatigued Indian side faced a 1-2
            drubbing
            against England at home as India's Test team hit rockbottom. The team's abysmal performances in the longer format
            raised
            serious questions about Dhoni's leadership and a whisper of his sacking; a somewhat misplaced and impulsive
            proposition,
            given the poor overall performance of the entire team, their inept technique against spin (which is their forte), an
            overflowing timetable, and a plethora of viable explanations.</p>
        <p>However, the transition phase in Indian cricket saw the famed batting line-up failing to meet their lofty standards,
            and
            a rather raw bowling fast-bowling line-up with negligible experience struggling, as Zaheer Khan suffering from a
            long-term injury.</p>
        <p>There was only so much Dhoni could do...</p>
        <p>However, after taking some tough selection calls, Dhoni led the way in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a marathon 224
            in
            Chennai, setting the platform for a clean-sweep of Australia at home, clinically blanking them to regain the trophy.
            India became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash Australia in a Test series and Dhoni now had the most
            Test wins for an Indian captain under his belt.
        </p>
        <p>India's poor Test form had unfortunately seeped into the ODI fold as well. However, Dhoni developed an uncanny
            ability
            to play a symbolic game of poker during run-chases, and backing himself to finish it off in the last over without
            blinking. He repeated this feat multiple times: whacking a 112-meter six to clear the Adelaide boundary with 12 to
            win
            off 4 in the CB series, chasing down 15 in the last over in the Celkon Cup final to name a few, and a ridiculous 23
            off
            the last over in a run-chase off Axar Patel to win a dead-rubber in IPL 2016; with the equation at 12 to win from 2,
            he
            dropped jaws by clouting two sixes to pull off a scarcely believable victory.</p>
        <p>He had started to build a reputation of being one of the most reliable batsmen limited-overs cricket, taking India to
            victory constantly from the jaws of defeat. For instance, his century batting at No.7 against Pakistan at Chennai, a
            stunning 113 walking into the crease when India were 29 for 5, was a knock that symbolized the leader MS Dhoni who
            led
            by example, as well as exhibited sharp tactical nous: a much sought-after combination in a captain.</p>
